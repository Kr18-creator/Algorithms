""" Summary
Time Complexity: 
O(n2) for best, average, and worst cases.
Space Complexity: 
O(1)
Hereâ€™s a summary of the selection sort algorithm with its time and space complexities:

Initialization: Set min_index for the current position.
Find Minimum: Iterate through the unsorted part to find the minimum element.
Swap: Swap the found minimum element with the first unsorted element.
Repeat: Repeat the process for the next element until the entire array is sorted."""



def selection_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        # Assume the minimum is the first element
        min_index = i
        # Iterate over the unsorted elements
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            # Find the minimum element in the remaining unsorted array
            if arr[j] < arr[min_index]:
                min_index = j
        # Swap the found minimum element with the first element of the unsorted array
        arr[i], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[i]
    return arr

# Example usage:
arr = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
sorted_arr = selection_sort(arr)
print("Sorted array is:", sorted_arr)




""""Advantages of Selection Sort Algorithm
Simple and easy to understand.
Works well with small datasets.

Disadvantages of the Selection Sort Algorithm
Selection sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst and average case.
Does not work well on large datasets.
Does not preserve the relative order of items with equal keys which means it is not stable.

Frequently Asked Questions on Selection Sort
Q1. Is Selection Sort Algorithm stable?

The default implementation of the Selection Sort Algorithm is not stable. However, it can be made stable. Please see the stable Selection Sort for details.

Q2. Is Selection Sort Algorithm in-place?

Yes, Selection Sort Algorithm is an in-place algorithm, as it does not require extra space."""
